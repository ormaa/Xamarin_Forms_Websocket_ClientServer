# Xamarin_Forms_Websocket_ClientServer
Xamarin Forms android + iOS App running Web socket client server, allowing to mobile devices to communicate between them.

This is a Xamarin Forms application, running on both IOS and Android devices.
It implement  a Websocket Server + Websocket Client, with basic feature : send and receive text message ( Chat )

In order to create this, I used some existing project :
https://github.com/donmesserli/WebSocketsEcho : to understand how to implement Client.
https://github.com/vtortola/WebSocketListener : to understand how to implement Server.

This is a simple  and basic project ( no beautiful architecture or design pattern here )
The purpose here is to understand how we could implement the websocket server and client in order to have mobile device comunication in both way, without REST webservice or similar technology.

Enjoy!
