# Xamarin_Forms_Websocket_ClientServer
Xamarin Forms android + iOS App running Web socket client server, allowing to mobile devices to communicate between them.

I create this Xamarin Forms application, allowing to run Native application on IOS and android ; with Web socket comunication.

I used this : https://github.com/donmesserli/WebSocketsEcho
and this : https://github.com/vtortola/WebSocketListener
to make this solution + project.

this is cimple, and just a basic project, allowing to understand how we could implement the server and client, and get a clean way to comunication in the 2 directions : server to clients + clients to server.

Enjoy!
